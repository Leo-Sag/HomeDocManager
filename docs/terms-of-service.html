<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
    By using family-document-manager ("the Application"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
    If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Application.
</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>
    family-document-manager is a personal household document management system that automatically organizes,
    categorizes, and manages documents stored in Google Drive using AI (Google Gemini).
    The Application is developed and operated by an individual developer for personal and family use.
</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google Account credentials.</li>
    <li>You must ensure that documents placed in the designated inbox folder are your own or that you have the right to process them.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any automatically extracted information (calendar events, tasks, summaries) for accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Google API Usage</h2>
<p>
    The Application accesses Google services (Drive, Docs, Calendar, Tasks, Photos) through
    OAuth 2.0 with limited scopes. By granting access, you authorize the Application to perform
    the following actions on your behalf:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create and manage documents generated by the Application (drive.file scope)</li>
    <li>Create and edit Google Docs for text consolidation (documents scope)</li>
    <li>Create calendar events from extracted dates (calendar.events scope)</li>
    <li>Create tasks from extracted deadlines (tasks scope)</li>
    <li>Upload photos to Google Photos (photoslibrary.appendonly scope)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can revoke the Application's access at any time through your
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account permissions page</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>
    The Application uses Google Gemini AI to analyze and categorize documents. AI-generated
    results (categorization, date extraction, summaries) are provided on a best-effort basis
    and may contain errors. Users should review all automatically generated content for accuracy.
</p>

<h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>
    The Application is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.
    The developer does not guarantee that the Application will be error-free, uninterrupted,
    or that document processing results will be accurate.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect,
    incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use
    of the Application, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loss or corruption of documents or data</li>
    <li>Incorrect categorization or misfiled documents</li>
    <li>Inaccurate calendar events or task entries</li>
    <li>Service interruptions or downtime</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Modifications to Service</h2>
<p>
    The developer reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Application
    at any time without prior notice.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
    These Terms of Service may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
    on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
