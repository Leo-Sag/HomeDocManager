<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    HomeDocManager ("the Application") is a personal household document management system
    that automatically organizes, categorizes, and manages documents stored in Google Drive.
    This privacy policy explains how the Application collects, uses, and protects your data.
</p>
<p>
    The Application is developed and operated by an individual developer for personal and
    family use. It is not a commercial product and is not intended for public distribution.
</p>

<h2>2. Data We Access</h2>
<p>The Application accesses the following Google services through OAuth 2.0 authentication:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Google Service</th>
            <th>Permission (Scope)</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Drive</td>
            <td>drive.file (files created by this app only)</td>
            <td>Create and manage documents generated by the Application for information consolidation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Docs</td>
            <td>documents</td>
            <td>Write extracted text and summaries to consolidated documents</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Calendar</td>
            <td>calendar.events</td>
            <td>Create calendar events from dates extracted from documents (e.g., school events, appointments)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Tasks</td>
            <td>tasks</td>
            <td>Create tasks from deadlines extracted from documents (e.g., submission deadlines)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Google Photos</td>
            <td>photoslibrary.appendonly (upload only)</td>
            <td>Back up photo-category documents to Google Photos</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>The Application processes your data in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Document Analysis:</strong> Documents placed in a designated Google Drive folder ("Inbox") are analyzed using Google's Gemini AI to determine their category, extract key dates, and perform OCR text extraction.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Organization:</strong> Based on the analysis, documents are renamed with a standardized format and moved to appropriate category folders within your Google Drive.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Extraction:</strong> Key dates and deadlines are extracted and created as Google Calendar events or Google Tasks entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Consolidation:</strong> OCR text and summaries are appended to consolidated Google Docs documents for reference purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Backup:</strong> Documents categorized as photos are uploaded to Google Photos for backup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No external storage:</strong> The Application does NOT store your document content, personal information, or file data on any external servers or databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Processing only:</strong> Document content is processed in-memory during the analysis phase and is not retained after processing is complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Your Google Account:</strong> All organized files, calendar events, tasks, and consolidated documents remain within your own Google Account.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> OAuth refresh tokens are securely stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager and are used solely for authenticating API requests on your behalf.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
    The Application does <strong>NOT</strong> share, sell, rent, or disclose your personal data
    or document content to any third parties. The only external service used for document analysis
    is Google's Gemini AI, which processes your documents under Google's own privacy terms.
</p>

<h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
<p>The Application implements the following security measures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All API communications use HTTPS encryption</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens are stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager (encrypted at rest)</li>
    <li>Administrative endpoints are protected with token-based authentication</li>
    <li>The Application runs on Google Cloud Run with Google-managed security infrastructure</li>
    <li>OAuth permissions are limited to the minimum scopes required for functionality</li>
    <li>The Application does NOT request full Google Drive access; only app-created files are accessible via the drive.file scope</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Revoke access:</strong> You can revoke the Application's access at any time through your
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account permissions page</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> Since all data remains in your Google Account, you can delete any files,
        calendar events, tasks, or documents created by the Application at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Request information:</strong> You can contact us to request information about what data
        the Application has accessed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
    The Application is designed for use by adults managing household documents.
    It is not directed at children under the age of 13.
    The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
